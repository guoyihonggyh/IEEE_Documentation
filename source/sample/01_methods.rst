Data Description
==============================================

IEEE Xplore is one of the most popular digital libraries provided by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers （IEEE）. It hosts more than 5.5M+ publications for engineering, computing, and technology information around the globe.

However, the high volume and speed of influx of the scholarly publications requires a more "intelligent" library system that can automatically comprehend and identify topics from the publications, which lays a foundation for facilitating efficient searches on library.

Since the size of the raw data are significantly large, it is not possible for one to train or test on the raw data. Then we need to sample the data from the database.

The data is devided into 6 level, where as the level rise up, the field of study would be more specific.

In practical, we would like to sample data level 0&1 and level 2.


Level 0&1 sample method:
==========================

Blablabla

Level 2 sample method:
==========================

Blablabla
